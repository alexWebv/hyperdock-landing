        <h1 style="color:var(--neon);margin-top:0">Terms of Service</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: 2025-01-01</p>

        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of HyperDock (the “App”) and the hyperdock website (the “Site”). By using the App or Site, you agree to these Terms.</p>

        <h2>2. Licenses & Use</h2>
        <p>We grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to install and use the App for personal or internal business purposes. You must not reverse engineer, decompile, or misuse the service.</p>

        <h2>3. Accounts & Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>Some features require an account or a paid plan (Free, Pro, Pro+). Subscriptions renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date. Taxes may apply.</p>

        <h2>4. Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <p>Payments are processed by our payment provider. We may issue refunds at our sole discretion where required by applicable law.</p>

        <h2>5. Voice, AI & Content</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Voice input:</strong> the App can convert your speech to commands. Audio can be processed locally or by integrated providers per your settings.</li>
            <li><strong>AI features:</strong> suggestions and chat are generated outputs that may be inaccurate. You are responsible for reviewing commands before running them.</li>
            <li><strong>Your content:</strong> commands, projects, and favorites remain yours. You grant us a limited license to process them to operate the service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our <a href="../privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> explains what data we collect and how we use it.</p>

        <h2>7. Acceptable Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>No unlawful, harmful, or abusive behavior.</li>
            <li>No unauthorized access to systems or data.</li>
            <li>No attempts to circumvent security or rate limits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App may integrate with third-party services (e.g., speech/AI providers, Git). Their terms and privacy policies apply when you use those integrations.</p>

        <h2>9. Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access if you breach these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time; cancellation stops future billing.</p>

        <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
        <p>The App is provided “as is”. We do not promise uninterrupted or error-free operation. To the extent permitted by law, we disclaim warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

        <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, HyperDock will not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, nor for loss of data, profits, or business.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms by posting a new version on this page. Continued use means you accept the changes.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact</h2>
